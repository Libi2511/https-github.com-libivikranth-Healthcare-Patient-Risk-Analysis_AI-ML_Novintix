Task 1 — EDA 
Analyze distributions of Age, Billing Amount, and Room Number. 
Visualize the frequency of Medical Condition, Admission Type, and Medication. 

Task 2 — Supervised Learning 
Prepare the dataset for predicting Test Results using the available features. 
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. 
Train a prediction model and evaluate performance using appropriate metrics. 
Display predicted vs actual values for test data. 

Task 3 — Unsupervised Learning
Anomaly Detection in Billing Amounts 
Identify unusually high or low Billing Amount values compared to typical cases. 
Detect entries that deviate significantly from expected billing patterns. 
Mark the detected anomalies for review. 
Provide a short interpretation of anomalies (e.g., rare expensive cases). 
 
Task 4 — AI Task (LLM-Based) 
AI Doctor Recommendation Generator 
Pass the patient’s predicted test result and key attributes (Age, Medical Condition, Medication). 
Generate a short AI-written doctor-style recommendation. 
Include health advice based on the predicted result. 
Produce one sample output.
